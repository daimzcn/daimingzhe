abstract: Kuahuqiao site, famous for its early rice cultivation, is taken to be
  a typical case of how agriculture emerged in a littoral environment in the
  early Holocene. However, the lack of fire history and local climatic
  reconstruction has hindered the detailed picture of agricultural origins and
  development. Here we report new records of TOC, BC, 𝛿13CTOC, 𝛿13CBC, and
  C/N, alongside published pollen and charcoal data. Our 𝛿13CTOC and C/N
  confirm the previously-proposed formation of wetlands, which offered
  favourable landscapes for rice paddy agriculture, prior to the appearance of
  the Kuahuqiao culture. Based on BC, 𝛿13CTOC, and 𝛿13CBC records we suggest a
  hotter but drier climate that would have benefited rice agriculture by
  augmenting the distribution of wild rice and C4 herbs. In addition, 𝛿13CTOC
  shows a decreased C3/C4 ratio as a signal of human occupation with
  manipulation of forest for hunting-gathering or/and land clearance for
  agriculture. Combined 𝛿13CBC and BC records oppose the proposal of intense
  fire use in early agriculture and suggest that fire use was constrained to
  domestic purposes. Flood events which seem to have terminated the Kuahuqiao
  culture left impressions in TOC, BC, 𝛿13CTOC, 𝛿13CBC
